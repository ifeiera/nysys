| NYSYS - HARDWARE INFO COLLECTOR FOR WINDOWS |
+---------------------------------------------+
v0.5.0 beta

This is NySys, a small and simple project for gathering hardware 
information on Windows. It's designed to run quietly in the background 
and send collected data as a JSON string through a callback. 
Pretty straightforward - no fancy stuff.

⚠ NOTE: This project is designed to build as a statically-exported `.dll`
If you want to build it as a fully static `.lib`, you'll need to 
make a few adjustments.

Made for QC Labs Axioo Indonesia.
This project acts as the backend for the QC client (NYTH Client), 
responsible for sending system info to a webapp.

---

WHAT IT COLLECTS:
Motherboard, CPU, GPU, Memory, Storage, Network (Ethernet & Wi-Fi), 
Audio Devices, Battery, Monitors.

For a complete example of collected data, see: `result.json`

⚠ NOTE:
This project is still under active development and is not yet 100% final.
There are many features and improvements that can still be added.
Proper and complete documentation is currently in progress.

---

BUILDING THE PROJECT:
Make sure you have Visual Studio (with C++ development tools) 
and CMake installed.
VStudio: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com
Cmake: https://cmake.org/download

To build, run the following from the project root:
> mkdir build  
> cd build  
> cmake ..  
> cmake --build . --config Release  
or
> just run build.exe

This will generate `nysys.dll` and its import `.lib` inside 
`build/Release`, along with example programs.

---

HOW TO USE:
Once built, you’ll get a DLL to integrate into your project. 
Both C++ and C interfaces are available.

Usage flow:
1. Set a callback function - to receive the JSON data  
2. Start monitoring - runs in a background thread  
3. Let your app run - data will stream via callback  
4. Stop monitoring - shuts everything down

Check the `examples/` folder for full demos:  
- `example_cpp.cpp` (C++)  
- `example_c.c` (plain C)

That's it. Have fun.
